#### Coursework of Computer Graphics ####

#### Content and Key-points ####
+ ```OpenGL``` library is used within this project.

+ **Hierarchical structure** is demonstrated by the moving of the human-like protagonist.

+ **Texture mapping** is demonstrated with self-drawing checkboard.

+ **Lighting** and **Shadowing** are available.
  + The two lights, one at the left of the window and one at the right, are in different colors.
  + So the man will appear bright and white at first while dark and brassy at last.
  + Shadowing on the corner is demonstrated.

+ Both the camera (viewpoint) and the protagonist could move.
  + During the first three seconds, both the protagonist and the camera move.
  + Then the man will stand still while only the camera moves in a round track for one second.

#### Execution ####
